Title: VPC Peering Hands-On Lab*

ðŸš€ *Project Overview*:  
This project demonstrates how to set up VPC Peering in AWS to connect two different VPCs within the same AWS account and enable private communication between them. It involves creating both a default VPC and a custom VPC, establishing a peering connection, and configuring route tables for successful communication.

ðŸ”§ *What You'll Learn*:
- Setting up VPCs (Default and Custom) in the same AWS account.
- Establishing a VPC Peering connection.
- Modifying route tables to facilitate the peering connection.
- Deploying and connecting instances in both VPCs.

ðŸ“– *Step-by-Step Guide*:
1. *Create Two VPCs*:
   - Create a Default VPC and a Custom VPC with different CIDR ranges.

2. *Establish a Peering Connection*:
   - Set up a peering connection between the Default VPC and the Custom VPC.

3. *Edit Route Tables*:
   - Update the route tables in both VPCs to include the peering connection, enabling cross-VPC traffic.

4. *Launch EC2 Instances*:
   - Deploy a *public* instance in the Default VPC and a *private* instance in the Custom VPC.

5. *Test the Connection*:
   - From the public instance, SSH into the private instance using its private IPv4 address.

ðŸ”— *Why Use VPC Peering?*:
- *Cost Efficiency*: Direct connection between VPCs without needing VPN or Direct Connect.
- *Low Latency*: Fast, low-latency traffic between VPCs in the same region.
- *Security*: Maintains the isolation of each VPC while allowing specific traffic to pass through.

ðŸ›  *Tools and Technologies*:
- AWS VPC
- EC2 Instances
- VPC Peering
- SSH

ðŸ”— *Real-World Applications*:
- *Same-Account Connectivity*: Perfect for communication between VPCs in the same AWS account, making it ideal for scaling services and optimizing resource separation.
- *Multi-VPC Architectures*: Easily allows applications and services deployed in separate VPCs to communicate with each other securely and efficiently.
